# 2d-discharge-nn
  Neural network surrogate models of 2D discharge simulation data. Initial code written by Ikuse-san, modified by Jarl.
  
Model is currently a deep multilayer perceptron. Architecture was only determined using trial-and-error. Ideal parameters may be determined by some kind of hyperparameter search.
