# 2d-discharge-nn
  Neural network surrogate models of 2D discharge simulation data. Initial code written by Ikuse-san, modified by Jarl.
  
Model is currently a deep multilayer perceptron. Architecture optimized for loss using OpTuna.

Currently looking into different approaches after figuring out the neighbor regularization. PINNs might work better.
